      abstract = {Number fields and their rings of integers, which generalize the rational numbers and the integers, are foundational objects in number theory.   There are several computer algebra systems and databases concerned with the computational aspects of these.  In particular, computing the ring of integers of a given number field is one of the main tasks of computational algebraic number theory.   In this paper, we describe a formalization in Lean 4 for certifying such computations.   In order to accomplish this, we developed several data types amenable to computation.  Moreover, many other underlying mathematical concepts and results had to be formalized, most of which are also of independent interest.  These include resultants and discriminants, as well as methods for proving irreducibility of univariate polynomials over finite fields and over the rational numbers.  To illustrate the feasibility of our strategy, we formally verified entries from the Number fields section of the L-functions and modular forms database (LMFDB).  These concern, for several number fields, the explicitly given integral basis of the ring of integers and the discriminant.  To accomplish this, we wrote SageMath code that computes the corresponding certificates and outputs a Lean proof of the statement to be verified.},

      abstract = {We present Aesop, a proof search tactic for the Lean 4 interactive  
      theorem prover. Aesop performs a tree-based search over a user-specified  
      set of proof rules. It supports safe and unsafe rules and uses a best-first  
      search strategy with customisable prioritisation. Aesop also allows users  
      to register custom normalisation rules and integrates Lean's simplifier to  
      support equational reasoning. Many details of Aesop's search procedure are  
      designed to make it a white-box proof automation tactic, meaning that users  
      should be able to easily predict how their rules will be applied, and thus how  
      powerful and fast their Aesop invocations will be.  

      Since we use a best-first search strategy, it is not obvious how to handle  
      metavariables which appear in multiple goals. The most common strategy for  
      dealing with metavariables relies on backtracking and is therefore not  
      suitable for best-first search. We give an algorithm which addresses this  
      issue. The algorithm works with any search strategy, is independent of the  
      underlying logic and makes few assumptions about how rules interact with  
      metavariables. We conjecture that with a fair search strategy, the algorithm  
      is as complete as the given set of rules allows.},

      abstract={Neural theorem proving combines large language models (LLMs) with proof assistants such as Lean, where the correctness of formal proofs can be rigorously verified, leaving no room for hallucination. With existing neural theorem provers pretrained on a fixed collection of data and offering valuable suggestions at times, it is challenging for them to continually prove novel theorems in a fully autonomous mode, where human insights may be critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots that assist humans in proving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, a general framework for running LLM inference natively in Lean. It enables programmers to build various LLM-based proof automation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of Lean users. Lean users can use our pretrained models or bring their own ones that run either locally (with or without GPUs) or on the cloud. Using Lean Copilot, we build LLM-based tools that suggest proof steps, complete proof goals, and select relevant premises. Experimental results on the Mathematics in Lean textbook demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to existing rule-based proof automation in Lean (aesop). When assisting humans, Lean Copilot requires only 2.08 manually-entered proof steps on average (3.86 required by aesop); when automating the theorem proving process, Lean Copilot automates 74.2% proof steps on average, 85% better than aesop (40.1%). We open source all code and artifacts under a permissive MIT license to facilitate further research.},
