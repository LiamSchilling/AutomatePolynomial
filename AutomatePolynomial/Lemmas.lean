-- PROBLEM
open Polynomial
#reduce DegreeLe.D (1 : Int[X]) -- reduces to 0 as expected
#reduce Coeffs.C (1 : Int[X]) 0 -- reduces to 1 as expected
#reduce (degreeEq_of_coeffs (1 : Int[X])).D -- does NOT reduce to 0 as expected: idk why anymore
example : (X + C 8 : Int[X]).degree = 1 :=
  let _ : (degreeEq_of_coeffs (0 : Int[X])).D = ⊥ := by sorry -- rfl does not resolve
  sorry
